			Project Sought
		</h2>
		<p>
			I am open minded in terms of what capstone project to pursue, but projects 16 and 17 on the pdf list really sparked my interest because they both relate to video games, which I have a big interest in. I think I would really like to pursue a capstone project that relates to motion tracking, game simulation, and/or model development.
