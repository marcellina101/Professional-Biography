# Project Topic Area: 
- Project Focus: We would like to create a new library for Arduino that is focuses on gps location based around sound (essentially a library that allows arduino robots to easily track sound)
- REVISION:
   * Distance between what we’re hearing and the new sound
    * If difference is below or above a certain threshold you can then say its a gunshot or not
    * Metric of distance or similarity
    * Time domain and frequency domain
    * Look up table
   * Starts by measuring decibels then compares it to what’s stored
    * Range of time -  if within range then match to sound, if not …
    * When decibel raises above a certain level then it will start in order to match to new
   * Testing
    * Sound vary and determine how much variation system can tolerate
